Files:

sec.py: Contains the main function, pred, which receives a string with
        the sequences of the protein letters (one letter codes) and
        returns a string composed of the letters "H" (Helix) "S"
        (Sheet) "U" (coil) representing the secondary strucure.

plib: Prediction library, is imported by sec.py and contains all the
      functions necessary for the prediction

probtable: table of probabilities used by the functions for
           prediction. This file should be in the same directory as
           the program.

locf: directory with a bunch of proteins in a local file format. These
      can be translated to a string represntation using the file fileconv

fileonv: program that takes a file ".ale" in the locf directory,
         converts it to a string of protein one-letter codes, and
         prints it either on the screen or on a output file.
